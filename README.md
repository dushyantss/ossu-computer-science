# Summary

This repository tracks my progress through the [OSSU Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). My work is tracked in private repositories, where applicable, so that no honour policies are broken.

**Summary of the curriculum according to OSSU**

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken high school math and physics, including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
Some high school graduates will have already taken AP Calculus, but this is usually only about 3/4 of a college calculus class, so the calculus courses in the curriculum are still recommended.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

[Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers#!) ([alt](http://ulaff.net/)) I did not like this course at all as it focused a mostly on computation and very little on the actual concepts of linear algebra. It is teaching how to do linear algebra much more than what is linear algebra. So, instead I am going to do this one [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) | 15 weeks | 8 hours/week | Essence of Linear Algebra | In Progress

<sup>**1**</sup>: Students struggling with MIT Math for CS can consider taking the [Discrete Mathematics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) first.
It is more interactive but less comprehensive, and it costs money to unlock full interactivity.

### Core systems

Skip to the second course (Nand2Tetris) when the first course (CS50) moves away from C.

## Advanced CS

After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

`debugging theory and practice`

### Advanced applications

These Coursera Specializations all end with a Capstone project.
Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum.
Note that doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money.
So if you don't wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final, it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.

## Final project

## Pro CS

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or quite close to one.
You can stop in the Advanced CS section, but the next step to completing your studies is to develop skills and knowledge in a specific domain.
Many of these courses are graduate-level.
