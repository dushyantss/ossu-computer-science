This Project is going to track my ossu progress.

# Updates
OSSU has changed the curriculum's order and courses. They have replaced the Linear Algebra course(which I disliked because it did not teach the concepts of linear algebra, rather all it taught was using their code generator to write fast matrix calculations) and ops-class.org course(which I liked because of how tough it was, but I can understand that it was very out of place in this program. They have also changed the order of various courses and introduced/removed a few other.

Thus, I am updating this file to become up to date with the latest course from OSSU.

# Summary

This repository tracks my progress through the [OSSU Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). My work is tracked in private repositories, where applicable, so that no honour policies are broken.

**Summary of the curriculum according to OSSU**

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken [high school math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/high-school-math), including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. Choose one of the two course series below. Either one will give you an introduction to programming that assumes no prior knowledge. You can audit either for free, _in order to do so, click through to the individual courses in the specializations_.

Trying to decide between them?

_Python for Everyone_ will introduce you to a popular language and will quickly move to practical programming tasks - using web APIs and databases. This will give you a taste of what many professional developers do.

_Fundamentals of Computing_ will also start by introducing you to Python. It then moves on to give an introduction to academic Computer Science topics, like sorting and recursion. This will give you a taste of what the following courses will be like. (Students who complete _Fundamentals of Computing_ can skip Intro to Computer Science and begin Introduction to CS Tools.)

**Topics covered**:
`simple programs`
`simple data structures`

## Advanced CS

After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

### Advanced programming

**Topics covered**:
`debugging theory and practice`
`goal-oriented programming`
`GPU programming`
`CUDA`
`parallel computing`
`object-oriented analysis and design`
`UML`
`large-scale software architecture and design`
`and more`

([Why?](FAQ.md#why-is-the-curriculum-missing-some-pre-requisites))

### Advanced applications

These Coursera Specializations all end with a Capstone project.
Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum.
Note that doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money.
So if you don't wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final, it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.
